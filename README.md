Title:
Hydraulic bore interaction with a column - A comparison
between the solution of the shallow equation and experimental
results

Abstract:
In this paper we compare the solution of the shallow water equations with experimental results. The experiment simulates the interaction between an incident bore and a free-standing coastal structure. The shallow water equations are solved using the GeoClaw solver of the CLAWPACK software.
Three different cases are simulated and compared. In the first case a simple dam break problem is performed and evaluated.
The history of the wave height and velocity at the center location, where the column will be mounted are compared. 
In the second case, a square column is added and wave height at various locations in front of the column are measured and compared. 
For the third case, the square column is replaced by a cylinder column and the same variables are measured and compared. 
The discrepancy between the GeoClaw simulation and the experimental results are discussed and analyzed.
