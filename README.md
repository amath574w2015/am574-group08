abstract
In this paper we compare the solution of the shallow water equations with experimental results. The experiment simulates the interaction between an incident bore and a free-standing coastal structure. The shallow water equations are solved using the CLAWPACK software.
Three different cases are simulated and compared. In the first case, the column is removed. 
This is a simple dambreak problem and history of wave height and velocity at where column center should be are measured and compared. 
In the second case, a square column is set and wave height at some locations ahead the column are measured and compared. 
For the third case, the square column is replaced with a cylinder with the same data measured and compared. 
The discrepancy between geoclaw simulation and experiment results are also discussed and analyzed in a deep manner.
