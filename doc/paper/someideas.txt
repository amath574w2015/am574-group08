#done 1.From the farthest gauge data, why peak in experiment results arrives later than geoclaw -> property of hyperbolic equation: water in front of shock remain static.


#done 2.Why there are two peaks in wave height history -> one is due to arrival of shock, another is because of wave reflected by column

#done 3.Why exp result does not have jump when shock arrive but smooth increase instead.

4.why we see no wave height elevation from gauge behind the column -> 1)wave cannot propagate to there 2)near the edge of column, there is a ramp instead of vertical wall due to topography file.
