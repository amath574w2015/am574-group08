1.When running make .output, it reported some global variables is not there. I guess it was because subroutine setprob.f is not called in main program. 
At this stage, I delete setprob.f in Makefile and try to define sloc,hl,hr... as local variable in qinit.f




#todo
1.check $(GEOLIB)/setprob.f90 \
